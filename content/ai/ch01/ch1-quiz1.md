(`BK-IZER`): This function takes in anything and produces:

   * `'M` if the argument is not a list
   * `'B` if the list contains at least three elements (at the top
     level)
   * `'K` when the list contains at most 5 atoms anywhere inside it
     (including in nested lists)
   * A list containing the results of running `BK-IZER` on the
     contents of the input list if none of the above apply.

You may use any functions you wrote for homework without rewriting
them here. You must work independently (no help).
