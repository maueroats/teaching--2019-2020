There are several problems with the "base model" General Problem
Solver: 
   
   * Clobbered goal: achieving one goal causes another goal to
     be lost.
   * Leaping before you look: committing to a "strategy" that is
     impossible to finish (and missing another method). 
   * Infinite loop: trying to find a way to achieve a goal causes you
     to need that same goal, again and again.

You should be able to give examples of goals and operations that would
give rise to each of these problems with a "naive solver".
