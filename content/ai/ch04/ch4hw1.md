Read pages 99-101 in the book and write `complement` and `find-all`,
possibly copying them from the book.

1. (`ball`)

   * Make a structure `ball` that holds the `kind` of ball (a symbol)
   and the `circ`-umference of the ball (in inches, a number). 
   * Create a softball with a circumference of 12.
   * Modify the circumference to be 13.
