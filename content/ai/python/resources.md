To get started with Python, you need a Python interpreter and a text
to follow. 

## Python Book

The text I recommend is _How to Think Like a Computer
Scientist_, by Allen Downey et al. This book was released for free, so
there are several editions. 

* [online book](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)
* [interactive online book - includes interpreter](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html)
* [paper book](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist/dp/1491939362/)

You could also use the [official Python 3
tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). It is great,
but you would need to make up your own exercises.

## Python Interpreter

You either need Python installed locally on your computer, or use an
online interpreter.

Online:

* [Repl.it Python3](https://repl.it/languages/python3).
* [Repl.it Python Turtle](https://repl.it/languages/python_turtle).
  I only use this for turtle graphics. 

Local:

* [Anaconda with Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

On the school computers, you can use the version of Python installed
on the shared drive.
