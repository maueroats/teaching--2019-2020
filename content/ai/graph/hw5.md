* 6.5 Does either Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm work if there are negative edge weights? Explain why or why not. 

* 6.6 Suppose we are given the minimum spanning tree T of a given graph G (with n vertices and m edges) and a new edge e=(u,v) of weight w that we will add to G. Give an efficient algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree of the graph G+e. Your algorithm should run in O(n) time to receive full credit.

* 6.7 (a) Let T be a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph G. Construct a new graph G′ by adding a weight of k to every edge of G. Do the edges of T form a minimum spanning tree of G′? Prove the statement or give a counterexample.
(b) Let P={s,…,t} describe a shortest weighted path between vertices s and t of a weighted graph G. Construct a new graph G′ by adding a weight of k to every edge of G. Does P describe a shortest path from s to t in G′? Prove the statement or give a counterexample.
