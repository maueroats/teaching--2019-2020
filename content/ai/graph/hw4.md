description: "Find the minimum weight vertex cover for a graph."
---

A _vertex cover_ is a subset of vertices to that every edge contains
at least one vertex from the cover.

We will work on three variations of vertex cover:

1. Minimum size 
2. Minimum weight, where weight = degree of vertex used in the cover.
3. Minimum weight, where weight is any positive number associated with
   the cost of including a vertex in your cover.
