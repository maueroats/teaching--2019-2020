1. Diameter of a graph

2. A _vertex cover_ of a graph $(V,E)$ is a subset $V'$ of vertices so that every
   edge in the graph contains at least one vertex from $V'$. Given a
   graph, produce a vertex cover for it.
   
3. An _independent set_ of a graph is a subset $V''$ of the vertices
   so that no edge contains both vertices from $V''$.
