* PROGRAM(S): [Portacle](https://portacle.github.io/), which is a
  portable Common Lisp built on [SBCL](http://sbcl.org/) and
  [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) using

Northwestern University's [EECS
325](https://courses.cs.northwestern.edu/325/admin/lisp-setup.php)
course covers way more than we could ever hope to cover in a high
school course. Their web site contains detailed information about 
[Lisp
