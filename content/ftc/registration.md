You must be officially registered to attend any official FIRST
Event. We are First Tech Challenge (FTC) team number 3216 ("old") or
15659 ("new"). **There are three permission slips to return if you
attend meet 1.**

* First permission slip: either online (see below) or [printable form](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/first-youth-team-member-paperwork-2016-2017.pdf). 
* Second permission slip: [Illinois FTC
  Consent](http://registration.firstillinoisrobotics.org/Consent.aspx?ConsentID=0&TeamID=0). Choose
  team 15659 ("Young Droids") unless you have talked to Doc.

## Online Registration

* [Online registration guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/youth-registration-guide-v3.pdf) - This is a walkthrough of the registration process. Follow it!
* [Online registration instructions](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-team-member-consent-and-release-form). Pretty dense reading.

* Date: Saturday, November 9, 2019
* Times: 10am-4pm. (Usually runs late.)
