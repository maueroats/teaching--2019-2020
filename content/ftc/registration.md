You must be officially registered to attend any official FIRST
Event. We are First Tech Challenge (FTC) team number 3216 ("old") or
15659 ("new"). **There are two permission slips to return.**

* [Online registration guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/youth-registration-guide-v3.pdf) - This is a walkthrough of the registration process. Follow it!
* [Online registration instructions](https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/youth-team-member-consent-and-release-form). Pretty dense reading.
* [Printable form](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/first-youth-team-member-paperwork-2016-2017.pdf). If all else fails, print this form and turn it in.
* Second permission slip needed (beginning 2018-2019): [Illinois FTC Consent](http://registration.firstillinoisrobotics.org/Consent.aspx?ConsentID=0&TeamID=0))
