Git is a system for keeping track of all of the versions of things you write, both old and new. 
The whole system is quite complex, so we will limit ourselves to a small portion of what it can do.

You will use it for several purposes: 

* Turning in your work
* Backing up your work
* Transferring work to and from home via the internet instead of using a flash drive
* Collaborating with a group

## Incomplete

It is impossible to write down everything you need to know about git. Even experienced developers need to look things up. There is the [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book and many [StackOverflow questions about git](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git?sort=votes&pageSize=15) that you can learn from.
