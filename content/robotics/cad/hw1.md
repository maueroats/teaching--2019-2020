## 1a

Make the circle tangent to the line.

## 1b

Start with the figure below and make an equilateral pentagon (same
size sides, all touching).

## 1c

Start with the figure below. Put the circle of radius 1.5 and the
circle of radius 2.5 with the same center. 

* Circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. 
* Circle of radius 2.5 tangent to the circle of radius 2.0 at a point
on the x-axis.

## 2. 

Make the two diagonal lines parallel to each
 other, both 5in long, and each triangle isosceles, so the
 "non-parallel" sides are the same length in a given triangle.

## 3.

Start with four connected line segments and a circle centered at
  the origin. Put a point on one of the line segments.
  
   * Line segments meet at right angles. 
   * The point is coincident with the circle. 
   * One line segment is tangent to the circle (and touching it).

## 4.

Start with two semicircular arcs, one with a radius of 2 and one
  with a radius of 3. 
  
  * Arcs share the same center.
  * Center of the circle is 1.5 inches to the left of the origin and
    0.5 inches below the origin. (Construct segments.)
  * Height of the rectangle below the circles is 1.75 inches.
