There are really two principles of using variables:

* Use variables to remember things.
* Use variables to control the action. 

You will learn these principles through the experience of figuring out
how to do little mini-projects in Scratch.

* [Muddy

* [Walk and
  Spin](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BypGcwjV5LOHc3ZRV1JPMUk4cWM). A
  nice project.

* [Snow White and the Poison
  Apples](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BypGcwjV5LOHTzRfa2tiM2FUZkU). 

* [Tracking Points and
  Touch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S6vjj6DLckDxU3ORVm1b_QCuGza2-PNe44kie6VlsPg/edit?usp=sharing). A simple
  mini-project to teach you how to use variables. Summary: Get points
  when your character 
  touches the other sprites. Touching one sprite is special - makes you turn
  blue. Double points while you are blue.
