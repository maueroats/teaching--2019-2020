1. Arf the Dog gets five points when he eats a cupcake and two points for
   eating a hotdog. When food is eaten it disappears. Reset the points
   when you click the green flag.

2. There are two variables. One is a "goal" number. The other is the
   "current" number. 
   
   * You control the current number with the arrow
   keys (up, down). 
   * When the current number matches the goal number, 
   the backdrop changes to "You Win".
   * Set the goal number to be a random number 1 to 10 when green flag
     is clicked.
   
   
<!-- Teacher notes: 

1. Arf the Dog: students do not name the variable appropriately. 
   Lots call it "variable". 

2. Designed to teach students to use variable names, since there are two.
