Write down your solution.

You stand on a platform with a pair of wings near you.

* Touch the wings to pick them up.
* Fall when not touching the platform if you have no wings.
* Hover or fly if you do have wings. (Can go up, don't fall down.)

Write: 

* Wings: all code needed.
* Character: Flying and falling
