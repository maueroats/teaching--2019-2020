There is water and air. If the main character is completely under
water for 10 seconds, they drown. When the character touches air, they
can breathe, so they will not drown 10 seconds if they go under water
again.

Example: Cat touches air, has 10 seconds of breath. Cat goes
completely underwater, breath goes 9..8..7... Cat touches air again,
breath back up to 10. Cat goes completely under water, breath goes
9..8..7..6..5..4..3..2..1.. and then the Cat drowns (show an end
scene).
