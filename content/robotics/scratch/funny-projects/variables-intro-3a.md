## Molly the Dog

Molly the Dog likes to play with her chew toy. Molly is vicious before
she plays with her chew toy, happy while she plays with it, and
relaxed after playing with it.

Make a variable `got toy` that is:

* 0 before Molly touches the toy
* 1 when Molly is touching the toy
* 2 after Molly is done playing with the toy

## Homer and the Donut

Design this project on paper, then program it on the computer:

* The donut starts out in a bag.
* Homer wants a donut, but he can't see the donut when it is in the bag.
* When the donut is in the bag, Homer won't eat it (because he doesn't
know it's there), even if he touches it.
* Click on the bag to take the donut out of the bag. (Now Homer will
  eat it.)
* Motion using keys or 
{{< scratch >}} go to [mouse pointer v] {{< /scratch >}}.



Advanced: If Homer has not touched the donut 10 seconds after it is
unwrapped, he glides to touch the donut.
