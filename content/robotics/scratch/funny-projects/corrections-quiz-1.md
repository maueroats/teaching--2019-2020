Get half of the points you lost back by doing corrections. 
No limit, you can get more points even if you have an A already.

## General Instructions

* Explain briefly what you did wrong. Examples: 

    + The block _x_ does not exist.
    + The block _y_ cannot fit inside a forever loop because it has a
      round top ("hat block").
    + The forever means my motion never stops.
    + No forever means I only check one time.

* Redo by writing an answer to a similar problem. (Change direction of
  motion, action, or trigger for action.)

## Question 3 (Smooth Motion)

For Question 3 correction, explain how to do the question below.
