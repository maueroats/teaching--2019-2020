1. Count (and show) how many times you click on the button
   sprite. Assume we have already made a "clicks" variable. 

2. Reset the count of clicks to zero when you hit "r".

3. There is a "Mario" sprite and a "Coin" sprite. 

   * Show on the screen how many coins Mario has touched.
   * When Mario touches a coin, it reappears in a random location.
   * Assume you have already made a "coins" variable.

4. Phil eats hamburgers. After he eats 5 burgers, he pixelates to
   "125". When he eats 10 hamburgers, he "wins".
