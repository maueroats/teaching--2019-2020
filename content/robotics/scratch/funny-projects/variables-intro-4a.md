description: "Samantha eats a hot pepper and a cookie, and drinks glass of milk."
---

Samantha could eat a hot pepper, drink a glass of milk, or get a
cookie (all by touching them).

* When Samantha eats a cookie and then drinks a glass of milk, she is
  happy.
  
* When Samantha eats a hot pepper and then drinks a glass of milk, she
  is relieved.
  
* If Samantha eats a hot pepper and then does not drink the milk
  within 10 seconds, she is "mouth on fire".

* Show how Samantha feels visually - either by changing her costume or
  having her say something.


## Details

* Items disappear when consumed (eat/drink/touch).
* Samantha can move with keys or follow the mouse pointer.
* The best way to do this follows the story line, so if Samantha
  drinks a glass of milk before she eats the hot pepper, she does not
  become "relieved", instead she will become "mouth on fire" (after
  the 10 seconds).
* In 2019 it was OK to ignore the order the food is eaten. (So
  "cookie + milk = happy" and "hot pepper + milk = relieved" no matter
  what order.)

## Discussion questions

1. What variable or variables should we use? How can we represent the
   action in variables?
   
2. What Scratch code can we write to determine if Samantha is "Happy"?

3. Write the code for the cookie.
