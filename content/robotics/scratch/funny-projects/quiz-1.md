1. When you click on Sammie, she says, "Hi Jane". After that, Jane
   says "Hi Sammie". Finally Sammie changes to her "Blue" costume.
   
2. When Ryder touches the wallet, it disappears. (No need to write
   motion.)
   
3. When you holding the "g" key down, the sprite moves smoothly in the
   45 degree direction. When you are not holding the "g" key, the
   sprite is not moving.
   
4. Hitting the "a" key causes the sprite to face left and move 5
   steps. Holding the "a" key results in a choppy motion.
   
5. Say "Boo" six times with a one second pause (where no speech shows)
   in between each one.
