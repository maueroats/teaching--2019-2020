You are in charge of making a show for DubTV.

Sprites: main character, other character, camera, computer.

Additional information: there is a "scene" area of screen to "film". (Could be a
sprite.)

* Get the camera sprite (touch it).
* Go to the "scene" and touch the other character. Hit "f" to film. 
* You cannot film unless you are in the scene area.
* You must be touching the other character to film.
* Go to the computer to distribute the video.
* Computer says "You have no footage" if you have not filmed.
* Computer says "Uploading DubTV..." and then five seconds later it
  says "DubTV ready!"

## Details

* Camera sprite disappears when you have it.

## Advanced

* When you are filming, use a diffent set of keys (wasd, arrows) to
  control the other character. Write the motions "up" "down" "left"
  "right" to a list.
* After DubTV is ready, you can go to a TV and touch it to "play" -
  then the TV says the actions with a short delay between each one.
