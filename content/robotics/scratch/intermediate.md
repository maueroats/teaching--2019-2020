Realistic motion in a game comes from two sources:

* Velocity - the rate (amount) a position changes.
* Acceleration - the rate (amount) the velocity changes.

You will learn several ways to simulate velocity and acceleration by
moving a variable amount or by changing your y coordinate by a
variable amount. 

Details: in a game, the "tick" speed is usually constant, so
changing something by 2 is really the rate "2 per tick". This means
that instead of worrying about a rate of change (=amount/time) we use ticks for
the time and just worry about the amount of change.

* Notes on using [Velocity and Acceleration](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YkEHTdaFwozOcdFUgKL3CZuEhw5LPvKxV38It5eU4Jc/edit?usp=sharing) to make a platformer game.

* A [velocity
  worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vRhE2TJO4gFBKKjmrnaYEqSv8CZp7rh0vxKYOXyw_k/edit?usp=sharing)
  to check your understanding of how a platformer game can be
  implemented in Scratch.
  
* ([Scratch Skills Review III](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSrv5MAC21hc4_QlLkHa-UK8nS8OzfnQcf234xIRV6o/edit?usp=sharing)) List of skills and three questions about
  variables and detecting touch. Nice mini-projects.
