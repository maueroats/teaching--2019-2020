* [Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/) is a sophisticated version of
  Scratch (but does not look as good). I recommend it when you are not
  programming something you want to be "art-like".

## Accessible 

This resource is not hard! It is a good place to start learning
scratch.

* [Computer Science Concepts in
  Scratch](https://stwww1.weizmann.ac.il/scratch/scratch_en/) -
  available as PDF download.


## Snap

* [Example Projects in
  Snap!](https://snap.berkeley.edu/examples). Look inside the examples
  and see how they are done. Get inspired and ask questions.
* [Beauty and Joy of
  Computing](https://bjc.edc.org/bjc-r/course/bjc4nyc.html). This is
  "AP-level Scratch", a fine level of difficulty if you are interested
  in programming.
* [Snap! 5.0 Reference
  Manual](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/help/SnapManual.pdf). A book
  with a lot of details about how to program in Snap, find mistakes in
  your programs, and work with all of the features of Snap from the
  "simple" like lists to complicated, like passing blocks as inputs to
  other blocks. The book starts at the beginning. If you get far
  enough into it, there are some very deep concepts that you will
  probably want to ask questions about.
