1. Ask a person how much breakfast they like. If they say "a lot", then you say "I prefer a little." Otherwise, say, "Sounds good to me, too."

2. The computer starts with $200. Ask if the computer wants to buy a cheap phone for $75. Ask if the computer wants to buy a cake for $30. Print how much money the computer has left at the end.

3. The room starts with a brightness of 60. Ask if the person wants the room "brighter" or "dimmer". Change the brightness by 10 in the direction they indicate. Print the new brightness. Advanced: keep asking until they say "off". 

4. A car is currently going 25 miles per hour. Ask "Should I go faster, same, or slower?" If they say faster, increase speed by 5 mph. Slower: decrease speed by 5 mph. Same or any other response you do not understand, keep the speed the same. Advanced: keep asking until they say "park".
