1. (Bedtime.) Ask the person if they have a book to read. Ask how many minutes until bedtime. Count down from that number to 0, then say bedtime. If they have a book, print "Stop reading!" and count down from 5 to 1 (again). In any case, say "Lights out!"
2. (Mini-Adventure.) PIck one item: flashlight, sword, school lunch. Choose one location: cave, meadow. At the cave, it is dark and scary unless you have the light. With the light you can find a diamond. In the meadow you are attacked by a troll. With the sword, you defeat it and find a gold brick. Otherwise you have to run away. At the end, print out what you have. (Examples: "You have a flashlight." "You have a gold brick." "You have nothing.")

        Pick one (flashlight/sword/school lunch): sword
        Choose a location (cave/meadow): cave
        It is dark and scary. You leave.
        You have a sword.

3. (Add-ons.) Modify your adventure so that the troll will take your flashlight. Make sure the printout of items still works.
4. (Gears.) Remember that the output teeth/input teeth determines the gear ratio. Ask how many teeth the input gear has. Ask how many teeth the output gear has. Print "The gear ratio is â€¦". Turn the input gear 20 rotations, and after each rotation print out many rotations the output gear has made. (Use math: input rotations * input teeth = output rotations * output teeth.)  
5. (Mini-Adventure II.) How much gold do you start with? Want to buy a
   sword (15 gold)? Want to buy a shield (10 gold)? Don't let them buy
   something they can't afford. Choose a location: river, forest. In
   the forest, you meet brigands. If you have a sword, you can defeat them and get 8 more gold. Otherwise they rob you and take your gold. On the river, you accidentally drop your shield into the water and lose it. (Advanced twist: if you don't have the sword, you can dive in to get your shield.) At the end, print out what you have.
