* Class is a [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/docmo_cs). You can
  watch it for up to two weeks after the stream airs.

* Recommendation: use [repl.it for
  Python](https://repl.it/languages/python3). It will save your work
  if you make an account.
  
## Classwork

**Assignments**: there are a few problems every day (3-5). The are
  posted in Google Classroom in a shared Google Doc. Please make sure
  your program runs before you submit it!

**Submitting work**. Mark the assignment complete after doing one of the
  choices below.

   - (choice #1) copy and paste the code in as a private comment 
   - (choice #2) paste the link to your repl.it as a private comment
   - (choice #3) do the work in a google doc and attach it for the
      assignment

## Asking Questions 

During class, you can ask a question about your code by just pasting
the link to your "repl" into the chat and typing your question. 
This requires a twitch account (optional).

Not comfortable posting publicly or don't want to make an account?
You can email doc mo (amauer-oats at cps dot edu). Include: link to
your code, description of what is wrong (what do you see and what do
you want to see). 

A lot of people skip spelling out the details when asking a
question. It's much less obvious what the problem is when someone has
not seen every step of the way. The more you say exactly what you
expect and what you see, the easier and faster you will get
help. Include the error message that you get if that's part of the
problem.

Sometimes people don't know how to start. It really helps if you can
make a guess based on a problem looking like something else we did in
class. Share the guess as a starting point so I will know what you are
thinking. Otherwise the "help" is going to be "look at problem 2 from
yesterday"... which you have probably done and actually you have a
more specific question about how to use that idea. The more you try
the easier it is to help.
