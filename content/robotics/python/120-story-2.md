description: "Lesson 2. Using variables."
---

In this lesson we practice using variables to remember things, and also
while to repeat.

1. (Warmup.) There are 12 slices of cake. Ask how many the person wants to eat. Print how many are left. (Keep asking until it's all gone.)

2. (Binge Watch) How many episodes are there? On day 1, how many do you watch? On day 2, etc… until they are all done. Then print "it took you XX days to watch the whole series."

3. (Workout.) There is a 100 push-up challenge. How many days does it take you to do 100 pushups? Every "day", say "On day X, how many pushups do you do?" Keep track, and once they have reached at least 100 pushups, stop asking and say "Congratulations, you did 100 pushups in XX days."

4. (Lockout.) You are at home. You are going to get stuff and go for a walk. Ask the person what they take with them. Remember that. Then ask them how many blocks they are going to walk. Count from 1 up to that number. Print "You are back home". If they took "keys" then say, "You go back inside." Otherwise print, "You are locked out."

Example:

    What do you want to take with you? Phone
    How many blocks are you going to walk? 5
    1…
    2…
    3…
    4…
    5…
    You are back home.
    You are locked out.
