You should review the [AP CS Skills Intro]({{% relref
"skills-intro.md" %}}) for the purpose of this assignment and
collaboration rules.

You can do this assignment at any time in the summer. Unlike a math
class, I do not believe it will be better to do the work in August
near when school starts. Spend some time on it and make something
good.


## Project Description

Write the two player board game known as [Reversi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi) or Othello.
Follow the initial setup and rules as described for Othello in the
Wikipedia page.

## Exceptions

Write the game in any language that you know. A text-based user
interface is perfectly acceptable. If you know Racket, it should be
easy to write a graphical interface. 

<!-- You could learn a new language
like Python over the summer and write you game in Python. (Perhaps
using PyGame, which can be set up just like a big-bang. -->

You may choose a different project, just review the list of skills
linked at the start of the document.

## Notes

My favorite advanced tools in Racket: `struct-copy`, `for/fold`,
and `match`. Check the Racket Guide.
