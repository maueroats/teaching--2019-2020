You may not use reference materials, the book, especially not Stack
Overflow or any of your old homework. 

1. Find the product of all odd negative integers greater than -2015.
   Create a tuple called `answer1` containing the sign (+1
   or -1) and the last two digits (the tens and units digit).
   
2. Create a list of lists to represent the inside of [this VigÃ¨nere
   cipher table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vigen%C3%A8re_square_shading.svg).

3. (`base3`) Write a function to convert a number to a list
   representing the number in base 3.
   
        base3 (81+9+3+1) == [1,0,1,1,1]

4. (`inCirc`) Create a list of all integers `x` that have `(x,-x)`
   inside the circle of radius `2*r` centered at `(r,r)`. You can use
   your own distance function or this one:
   
        dist :: (Int,Int) -> (Int,Int) -> Double
        dist (x0,y0) (x,y) = sqrt $ fromIntegral $ (x-x0)^2 + (y-y0)^2
