Write in Racket. You may use the Picturing Programs book and the
Racket Help Desk. You may not refer to old code except your
`posn-util.rkt`.


1. `english-q: string -> boolean`: True if every "q" in the word is
   followed by a "u".
   
2. `ternary-2: number -> number`: Find the number of 2s in the base 3
   representation of the number. You can look up what base 3 is. Write
   your own base 3 converter.
