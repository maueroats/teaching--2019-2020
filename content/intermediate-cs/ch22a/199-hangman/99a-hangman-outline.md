Use `define/contract` for all of your functions. Write two check
expects for every non-trivial function.

1. Three illustrations of "action" that should occur in the game. Explain what they are.
2. Model
3. Top-down design.
3. Image sequence and loading images into Racket.
4. Key-handler

     * Purpose
     * Examples: at least two (which become tests)
     * Write function.
5. Draw-handler

     * Purpose
     * Illustrations on paper (two) - easier than making computer examples.
     * Examples: at least two (which will become tests)
     * Write function.
6. Final screens: win and lose.
