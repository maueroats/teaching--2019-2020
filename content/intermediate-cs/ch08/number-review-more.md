More review problems:

1. Make an ellipse on a background. 
    + The ratio of the width to the height of the ellipse is 3 to 4.
    + The x-coordinate of the mouse controls the width.
    + Hit any key to reset the ellipse to 60 by 80.
    
2. A point moves on the graph of y = abs(x-90).
    + The point starts at (0,90).
    + The point goes back to (0,90) after it gets to (200,110).
    + The origin is in the lower left (people coordinates, quadrant I).
    + Moving the mouse makes the point go faster.

3. A straight line goes through (50,25) and the point where the mouse is.
