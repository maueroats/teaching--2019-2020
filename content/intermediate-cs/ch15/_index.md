## Exercise Notes / Advice

* 15.3.4: The first input is the candidate for whom you are counting votes. (For example "Clinton".) The next four inputs are votes cast for a person. (For example "Trump" "Clinton" "Sanders" "Trump".) You are supposed to return the number of votes for the candidate from the first input. (For example: `1` in this case.)

* 15.3.7: Keep using `build-image` not `build3-image`.

## Images

See the [build-image]({{% relref "build-image.md" %}}) tutorial. Use that to do 15.3.3 and 
15.3.{7-10}. Do not use `build3-image` even though the book says to use it. The `build-image` function is better.
