These notes refer to the [2019 review
guides](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/).

* [Last Year's Topic
  List](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-topics-1/)
  is still very relevant. We did more with gradients and `build-image` this
  year, so you should add that to the list.

* [I.1 Review
  1](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-1/):
  All of these questions are relevant and were discussed this year.
  
* [I.2 Review
  2](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-2/):
  All good.
  
* [I.3 Review
  3](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-3/):
  Red-blue OK. Ignore reading. Others more complex.
  
* [I.4 Review
  4](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-4/):
  Question 1 only.

* [I.5 Review
  5](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-5/):
  "Extras: Lite Review Questions" only.
  
* [I.6 Review 6](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-6/):
  Graphing question is important. Others fine. Gas gauge tricky, not
  emphasized this year.

* I.7 Review 7: Skip.

* [I.8 Review
  8](https://maueroats.github.io/teaching--2018-2019/intermediate-cs/sem1review/sem-review-8/):
  Question 1 good (gradient).
