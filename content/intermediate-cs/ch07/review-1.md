1. (`rq1`) Write a function that takes in one input `n` and gives
random numbers between 100 and 1000. The first possible random number
is 100, and after that multiples of `n` more than 100. Example: When n
is 500, the only possible results are 100 and 600. When n is 2, every
even number from 100 to 1000 is possible.
