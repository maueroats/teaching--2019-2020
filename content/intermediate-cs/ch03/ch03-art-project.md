**Deadline**: Turn in by Friday, September 27.

**Produce**: One complex piece of art per person.


**Goal**: Art projects should demonstrate a range of functions from the
chapter, try to use 3-4 from each category in your whole project.

* Methods of placement: beside, above, overlay, place-image, as well as
the "`/align`" variations. (Use the variations!)

* Changing pictures: crop, scale, rotate.

* Shapes: triangles (many!), lots more listed at the end of Chapter 3 (PDF
  pages 60--61).

* Colors: `color-database`, `make-color` from the internet, `colorize`
or `name->color`.

**Remember**: This is a short project. _I expect you will spend no more than
three hours on it_, including time working in class Monday and Tuesday. 

It is OK to simplify and focus on using the goal functions (see
above).

## Steps

1. Find one inspiration piece of art.
2. Have idea approved before the first class ends.
3. Complete by working in class Friday and Monday, and possibly some
   time at home over the weekend.

## Choice 1: DrRacket's take on MoMA

Choose a piece of art for inspiration.

* School appropriate.
* No duplicates with anyone you know in any class.
* MoMA archive: 
    * [Textiles from Japan][japanTextile] - which could have [floral
      patterns][4] or [numbers from the cataloging process][5]
    * [Islamic art][islamicart] --- [like this][6]

## Choice #2: Picture Puzzles

Goal: create two pictures that are challenging or interesting to
recreate once they are finished. If you can get someone to say, "How
did you do that?", your puzzle is a success.
